# 14 — Prototype and Validation Plan

Purpose: prove the loop before content exists. Numbers are not designed on paper (Rule 8); they are
discovered here.

## 1. The core hypothesis to test

> A player will repeatedly choose "one more thing" over going home, because the detector hint, the
> partial silhouette, and the next affordable upgrade all pull harder than the battery warning.

A calm, voluntary return followed by eagerness to dig again is equally valid. Also test whether
related finds suggest a buried place, upgrades transform the scale of excavation, and major parts
build curiosity about one larger construction (W15, S17, D18).

## 2. Vertical slice scope (first playable)

| Element | Slice version |
|---|---|
| Site | One diggable area, full voxel, boundaries visible (concrete + bedrock) |
| Tool | One machine, 2–3 meaningful upgrade levels with visible bolt-on changes, hold/toggle digging, automatic material adaptation stub |
| Jetpack | Stable and usable from the start; ordinary falls are harmless |
| Materials | 3 distinct families with different feel (e.g., soil, clay, rock) |
| Detector | Tool reaction + edge hint, stable target; include one silent optional distinctive |
| Objects | The five first-slice objects: washing machine, hand drill, gearbox, mammoth bone, gramophone; special exhibit/component placeholders for their interactions |
| Clusters | One coherent buried scene, using a bone, vehicle, household or workshop template |
| Hard pockets | One concrete plug diggable by the current tool; upgrades or C4 are much faster |
| Pressure | Shared action-powered battery, return warning, loot-safe recovery fee/debt with a protected next outing |
| Economy | Sell All machine, two tracks (Tool, Battery), 1–2 purchases each, transparent shop |
| Display | Compatible shelf/stand spaces; individual special placement and rereading, no undiscovered silhouettes or inventory screen |
| Surface | Compact yard: shaft, machine, bench, fuel, display |
| Interface | Minimal HUD, world inspection, pause, full rebinding, controller support |
| Saving | Autosave + restore exact hole, position, charge, finds and display |
| Story | One anachronistic junk object for the mystery trail |

Explicitly out of the slice: zones 2–4, the full roster, the ending, achievements, photo mode, late
sinks and finished large-object content. Test local extraction beneath an overhang separately and
early; the whole-object payoff must work without a transport shaft to the sky.

## 3. Experiments (numbers to discover)

- Voxel size vs. dig satisfaction and recognition readability (W11).
- Starting shovel speed vs. frustration; fewer stronger upgrade steps and output on familiar ground.
- Battery drain per powered action vs. outing length; recovery frequency and empty-wallet restart.
- Bag capacity vs. trip length; where the hard stop actually lands.
- Detector range, frequency, quiet intervals; how often players follow cues.
- Recognition: exposure percentage at which players identify each of the five objects; test late
 wide cuts and C4 too. Full-bag overflow and interesting finds must survive.
- Cluster spacing: how far players search after finding one related object.
- Hard pocket: visible starting-tool progress vs. returning later for a much faster excavation.
- Rare find value: how many expeditions a "big find" should equal.
- Station time: seconds spent in the yard per trip; nonblocking selling/upgrades and individual
 special placement without underground carrying.
- Story delivery: compare before pickup and immediately before placement; display rereading in both.
- Once deeper content exists: test connected major parts, flexible discovery order, required-find
 trails, power growth against tougher ground, and useful play after the final major upgrade.
- Tool-tier regression: time-to-clear per material family for each new head vs the previous tier — no new tier may be slower in ground the player already digs.
- C4 value: digging time saved per charge vs its price — a charge must clearly pay for itself.

## 4. Validation metrics (playtest gates)

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| First noteworthy discovery | within the first 10 minutes, every seed |
| First-session full loop (onboarding) | an unguided tester finds, sells and buys in one session; nobody needs a wiki or video to complete one loop |
| Voluntary lateral digging | the majority of testers dig sideways at least once per session unprompted |
| Recognition quality | ≥ 80% of testers correctly name slice objects from partial exposure |
| Voluntary full uncovering | ≥ 70% choose to keep revealing an interesting object rather than skip it |
| Purchase cadence | prototype-tuned for fewer stronger steps; 30–45 min is an earlier milestone hypothesis |
| Trip decision | testers want another outing; pushing for one more find is optional, never a requirement for success |
| Return friction | yard + return time ≤ ~15% of session time |
| Station clarity | no tester asks what the Sell or Upgrade stations do after using them once |
| Recovery | fair, loot-safe and financially recoverable; ordinary return remains convenient |
| Save integrity | zero lost holes, inventories or display states across interrupted sessions |
| Feel | no floating snags; no unreachable pickups; no stuck spots |
| Performance feel | no cold-start hitch on the first dig; stable frame pacing while digging; no progressive decay across a long session (F13) |
| Save write latency | zero perceptible freeze/hitch; frame-impact budget is tested separately from total background save duration |
| Return navigation | testers find their way back to the surface unaided; none report feeling lost (W13) |
| Mystery tone (deep-zone pass) | once those zones exist, testers describe the impossibilities as awe and curiosity, never dread (Q13) |

## 5. The core test script (observe, don't explain)

1. New player, no tutorial, unguided 30 minutes.
2. Observe: what they dig, whether they follow cues, when they first return, how they react at each
 station.
3. Inspect the resulting hole: shape, lateral branching, abandoned pockets.
4. Interview: what they remember finding, what they wanted next, what annoyed them.
5. Compare against the metrics above; adjust content distribution and feedback before adding content.

## 6. Build order

1. **Feel prototype:** dig, materials, cleanup, jetpack, battery, recovery. No economy, no art.
2. **Loop prototype:** sell, upgrade, display, detector, first object recognition.
3. **Slice:** all vertical-slice elements above with placeholder art (custom models only per A01).
4. **Pacing pass:** multiple seeds, measure the metrics, tune generation rules.
5. **Content production:** zones 2–4, coherent places, connected construction, full rosters and ending.
 Validate part relationships and the final object before committing the full content set.
6. **Polish and release prep:** comfort settings, achievements, verification passes.

## 7. Release gates (design-side)

- Core test moment observed repeatedly in external playtests.
- All validation metrics met or consciously waived by the developer.
- Muted + auto-dig + controller-only full run completes with no blockers.
- Clean-save 100% completion verified (ending, special exhibits, tracks, zones reached); Steam
 achievements checked separately, with all required finds available in each seed.
- No save-loss, no terrain reset, no stuck states, no unreachable finds.
- First-session comprehension: unguided testers complete one full loop unaided and want a second trip.
- Session-length stress run keeps dig rhythm stable: no shader or streaming hitch on the normal
  digging path (F13).
- Save write latency check: saving an extensively deformed late-game excavation causes zero frame freeze or input hitch (I14, anti-pattern 42).
- Return navigation: testers get back to the surface unaided; no lostness or stuck reports (W13).
- Mystery tone check: testers read the impossibilities as wonder, not threat (Q13).
