# 05 — Discoveries

## 1. Find categories and tiers

| Tier | Count target | Detector | Destination | Money |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Common** | 20–30 types | Always silent | Sell only | Reliable income, worthwhile at any depth |
| **Distinctive** | 30–50 types | Noteworthy ones signal; some stay silent by design | Sell only; no first-copy/duplicate routing | Good money |
| **Unique** | Small set (a few) | Signals | Kept on the display forever; unsellable; one-sentence story; no mechanical perk | No sale |
| **Ending parts / keys** | 3–4 finale components; other keys by content | Required parts have a discoverable trail | Unsellable; automatically available when needed | No sale |

Commons include the mineral ladder (coal → copper → iron → silver → gold → emerald → ruby → diamond),
bottles, plain stones, commonplace scrap, packaging and rubbish. "Common" means routine to find
repeatedly, not merely familiar. **Uniques exist exactly once per save — never in multiples.**
Commons are visible before quick automatic collection, without inspection prose or popups;
distinctives are the special, repeatable middle tier. No found passive upgrades.

Each type has one purpose: ordinary and repeatable finds sell; a few special exhibits and keys are
unsellable. No keep/sell sorting. Ordinary hauls pay, and special finds get their own display moment.

## 2. The detector

The detector is passive equipment: the player never equips it. They simply dig.

- **Silent and visual.** No audio pings. Tool reaction plus a subtle screen-edge hint gives broad
 direction and proximity; no hidden outline or object identity.
- **Never reveals value or rarity.** A huge object may read "stronger" because of size, but the
 detector never says what it is. No "special cue" that makes ordinary finds feel like waste.
- **One foreground target at a time:** keep the current nearby target until collection or moving
 away. Quiet intervals between cues; no jumping between finds as the camera turns.
- **Eligibility is authored per object**, never decided by price, size or metal content. Some
 distinctive finds deliberately do not signal, so that digging itself keeps rewarding the player
 outside signal-chasing.
- Signals can always be ignored; required parts matter when the player chooses to finish the story.
- Required finds have trails of related objects and the existing broad detector cues. Collected finds
 stop signaling; revealed but uncollected targets remain detectable. No required detector upgrade.

## 3. The reveal and recognition loop

1. The player digs normally; the object appears partially.
2. **Interesting objects do not disappear when touched.** They stay physically present; the player
 excavates around them and watches the silhouette resolve.
3. Once enough is exposed, the object becomes interactable and can be collected.
4. **Recognition is the reward:** curved metal → handle → rectangular body → "…oh, it's a washing machine."
5. **Uniques tell a story:** one deadpan sentence, with first delivery decided in play. The
 current leaning is before placement; before pickup versus immediately before placement remains open.
 Placed objects always support inspection and rereading. No inventory reading or inspection of commons.
6. No archaeology: no brushing minigame, no 100% cleaning requirement, no identification timers, no
   mailing objects for appraisal. The game decides when enough is revealed; the player
   decides what is worth revealing.

Small/common finds are quick: a bite or two, instant pickup, clear feedback so nothing is collected
unseen. Interesting finds remain after wide cuts, support cleanup and C4; exposure makes them
collectible without requiring full cleaning or waiting for the player to name them.

**Moving discoveries**: objects respond physically as surrounding ground is removed. The
developer reports this is already implemented; retain it as part of the reveal feedback.
Common visibility before automatic pickup is also already implemented in the demo, according to
the developer.

**Finds inside finds**: occasional authored containers hold another discovery. Dig out a
suitcase, expose and open it with the existing tool, then see coins or an odd keepsake inside.
The outside gives a clue; the contents deliver a second reveal and a small piece of buried history.

- Use a few selected objects, not every box or appliance. Contents fit the container and its scene.
- Opening happens in the world with the same tool; no lockpicking, extra keys or inventory search.
- Contents become visible before normal collection. Ordinary valuables sell; special exhibits keep
 their existing display/story role. The container's own collection must not hide or lose its contents.
- Contents belong to the save's finite find population; opening or reloading never rerolls or
 duplicates them. Full-bag overflow follows the normal rules.

## 4. First-slice objects (built before bulk production)

| Object | Tests |
|---|---|
| Washing machine | Large appliance: box + circular door readability |
| Hand drill | Small handheld silhouette recognition |
| Gearbox / engine block | Machine parts; natural lead-in to a cluster |
| Mammoth bone / tusk | Organic curves; ties to the Danube bones inspiration |
| Gramophone | Funny, display-worthy oddity with a distinctive horn |

These five are prototyped and reviewed before any large content batch.

## 5. Related-object clusters

Five authored micro-scene templates to start, rotated and placed procedurally with slight jitter:

1. **Bone scatter** — skull fragment, ribs, tusk piece spread over a few meters.
2. **Vehicle parts** — wheel, axle, bumper, engine block, arranged as if a car sank here.
3. **Household cluster** — plates, bottles, stove, sewing machine in a collapsed heap.
4. **Machine fragments** — gears, drive shaft, boiler plate leading toward something larger.
5. **Odd arrangement** — deliberately placed objects (a circle of bottles around a tool), feeding
 the mystery.

Rules: authored relationships, no pre-dug chambers, counted once in the finite population, validated
for spacing. A cluster is a suggestion, never a quest marker.

Clusters should read as parts of a coherent buried place — a household, workshop or waterworks. The relationship gives the next dig a reason beyond another signal.

## 6. Large discoveries

A few per run (target 3–5): a car, a large appliance pile, a machinery section. The player
excavates most of it first; a short local extraction gives the physical payoff, then the whole object
is transferred to its surface destination. For suitable heavy finds (like a vehicle or boiler), this
local release can feature bladder-assisted unsticking: attaching salvage bladders that inflate with a
hiss, heave the find with a satisfying mud-release pop, and unstick it from the ground.

Once released, the whole object transfers to the surface automatically. No crawler sled, widened routes,
car-wide shaft to the sky or cinematic camera takeovers; the player stays in control. Test the transfer
presentation beneath ceilings and overhangs without visible cable clipping.
Extraction always delivers the whole object — a large find that yields only a token part reads as a
letdown. Some very large discoveries may remain in place permanently as landmarks; their
non-extractable nature is clear and discovery is credited in place.

Major discoveries gradually reveal parts of one enormous construction. Matching joints, seams
and fittings connect them; the final object explains what they belong to. Smaller finds continue around it.

## 7. Value and rarity

Value and collection roles:

1. **Common** — reliable income, always worth collecting, never trivialized by depth.
2. **Distinctive** — good money; the "that haul paid for the drill" tier.
3. **Rare** — several expeditions' worth, never enough to buy half the upgrade tree at once.
4. **Unique** — permanent display and story, no sale or mechanical effect.

No jackpots that finish the economy; no trash that feels like a waste of a slot.

The same item has the same price at every depth. Deeper zones can contain richer types or mixes;
a gold bar never receives a depth bonus. “Rare” describes a payout, not another upgrade system.

## 8. Display integration

- The surface display is a growing shelf/wall/column with **compatible spaces**.
- **Empty spaces are visible from the start; undiscovered shapes stay hidden**.
- A special exhibit is stored safely on pickup. At the yard, bring it out and place it individually;
 choose any compatible shelf space or stand, with neat snap placement. No carrying task underground.
- The display records name + depth found. No prices, no condition, no rarity labels.
- Placed objects support story inspection and rereading. Completion follows the exhibit collection,
 not an assigned arrangement. Basic display capacity never requires a frame purchase.

## 9. Inventory behavior for finds

- The bag is abstract; there is no physical carrying of buckets or crates, and no inventory screen.
- **Hard stop when full:** the player cannot pick up; the find stays exactly where it is in the
 world, and can be retrieved on a later trip.
- **Nothing is ever deleted.** No overflow teleport, no inventory destruction, no drop-on-death.
 Full capacity stops pickup, not digging or travel; excess valuables persist without blocking the route.
 No discarding; sale, extraction and reload preserve discovery credit.
- Uniques and ending components never consume capacity and are never lost.

## 10. References and humor

Original parody only: objects may evoke an era or a region without naming real brands, games
or people. The humor comes from what the object is and how the economy treats it — deadpan, not
loud. No body-sound jokes.

## 11. Mystery objects

The three-step escalation is delivered entirely through finds:

1. **Anachronistic junk** — a soda can too deep, a rubber duck in an ancient layer.
2. **Too correct** — a rustless tool, a bottle standing upright under tons of sediment, a part
 matching no nearby machine.
3. **Constructed impossibilities** — machinery built from ancient materials with a modern function.

The trail ends at the final object: **a modern object built in impossibly ancient materials**.
Its exact identity stays open; its construction makes the earlier major parts fit together.
An unusually intact ordinary object in undisturbed sediment can foreshadow this without an explanation.
