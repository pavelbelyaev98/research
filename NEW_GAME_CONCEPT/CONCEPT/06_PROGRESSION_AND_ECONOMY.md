# 06 — Progression and Economy

## 1. The shape of progression

- **One currency: money.** No second currency, no crafting, no blueprints, no license tiers, no RNG
 gates.
- **Money is banked only when sold at the surface**. This makes every trip a risk decision
 without ever deleting anything on failure.
- **Strictly sequential purchases:** you always buy the next level of a track; a lucky find cannot
 skip levels (I06).
- **Fully transparent shop:** current → next effect, cost, and practical benefit always shown;
 locked items visible with their requirement (S11).
- **The final meaningful purchase lands near the end** of the run so its power is used
 (target ~75–85% of first completion; prototype-tuned).

## 2. Upgrade tracks (six)

| Track | What it improves | Meaningful changes (cadence prototype-tuned) |
|---|---|---|
| **Tool** | Power, bite size, adaptation quality | New head/attachment, dramatically faster digging, much faster excavation of previously tough ground |
| **Battery** | Capacity and efficiency of the shared dig+jetpack battery | Longer expeditions; efficiency that makes old trips trivial |
| **Jetpack** | Speed, efficiency, assists | Sustained ascent, steering assists, hover hold |
| **Bag capacity** | Bag capacity | Strong steps; a full trip becomes a real haul |
| **Detector** | Range, cue clarity, broad direction | Confident long-range hunches |
| **C4** | Blast size, pack size, efficiency | Room-clearing blasts; cheaper demolition |

Per-track level count is flexible; use **fewer, stronger steps** (S02). Every purchase must noticeably
improve the next outing — no "invisible +5%" upgrades or cosmetic bolts standing in for power.
Purchases apply immediately, without a blocking animation. Power growth outpaces tougher ground,
so late excavation becomes dramatically larger and faster (S17).

## 3. Money in

- Commons and repeatable distinctives sell for money; rare finds can pay for a major purchase.
 Uniques give display and story, without money or mechanical perks (D05).
- A fixed price per item type: deeper zones contain richer types or mixes, but a gold bar always
 has the same price (S03).
- Common finds stay worthwhile at every depth; the deep game does not turn early income into
 garbage.
- Rare finds excite without breaking the curve; a rare find should afford one big upgrade, not half
 the tree.
- Cluster hauls and saleable large finds provide occasional big paydays. Display completion has no
 cash reward; the collection and story are the payoff.

## 4. Money out (including late game)

Primary: the six tracks.

Late-game sinks support remaining discoveries and optional decoration after the tracks are maxed (S03b):

- extra C4 charges;
- reusable lamps (buy individually; useful for lighting and photography);
- display decoration (basic shelf/stand capacity never requires a frame purchase);
- cosmetic tool skins and yard items;
- small conveniences (fuel top-ups, spare charges).

The site is finite. Once its discoveries and upgrades are complete, money may stop mattering. No
extra upkeep or repeated chores are added just to sustain spending (Q33).

## 5. Fuel (shared battery)

- One battery powers **digging and jetpack**.
- Drain occurs only during powered actions; reading, standing, thinking and inspecting never drain.
- Refills are **purchased at the surface**: full or partial, amount and price shown before purchase;
 bigger tanks keep current fuel rather than granting a refill (S04). The same refill quantity never
 costs more because the tank grew.
- **Return-power warning:** an adaptive indicator with safe / risky / critical states — never exact
 required-energy math. It accounts for depth and the route, not just a percentage threshold (S04).
 Unknown route geometry is not labeled safe.
- At zero fuel underground: automatic recovery to the surface with full fuel, **all finds kept**, a
 depth-scaled fee, and any shortfall as interest-free debt automatically deducted from future sales
 (Q26). No manual rescue option; no confirmation prompt.
- One disclosed rescue/refill bill, never two charges. Debt repayments protect the income needed for
 a basic refill. At zero charge in the yard, stay at zero until using the fuel point: no rescue or
 automatic refill. Walking and surface machines still work; if broke, the same interest-free account
 covers a basic restart charge.
- Tune recovery against normal return; shorten tedious travel before increasing the punishment.
- Recovery never blocks progress, never deletes items, and never permanently ruins a save.

## 6. Capacity (the bag)

- **Generous starting capacity**: the first expedition must already feel good; upgrades improve a
 loop that works, they do not repair a miserable one.
- Capacity grows in strong steps; the HUD shows count/capacity continuously (I01).
- **Hard stop when full:** you cannot pick up; the find stays in the world exactly where it is and
 can be retrieved later (S05b).
- **Nothing is ever deleted**: no overflow deletion, no inventory destruction, no loot loss on
 failure of any kind.
- Uniques and ending components never consume capacity. Full bags stop pickup, not digging or
 movement; nonblocking overflow remains in the world. No discarding.

## 7. Selling

- Selling happens only at the surface Sell All machine; there is no inventory screen.
- **One-button Sell All** (I05) with a physical, comedic machine animation and clear money feedback.
- Individual selling available at the machine for players who want it.
- Money is banked instantly on sale; there is no bank/branch/ATM system. The haul animation is
 nonblocking; the player can move on and buy an upgrade immediately.

## 8. What the economy never does

- No RNG-gated progression (no blueprints replacing shops).
- No condition/grading system (Q30c).
- No expiring coupons, time-limited offers or temporary boosts (S16).
- No found passive upgrades; all permanent mechanical power comes from the existing shop tracks (S10).
- No multi-currency.
- No dead end where everything is purchased halfway through the run.
- No loot deletion as a failure consequence.
- No item durability; tools never break.
- No object whose sale value increases by combining, stacking or re-merging — value is fixed per
  type (value-stacking exploits cannot exist by construction).
- No paid power, no premium currency, no microtransactions.
- Fix duplicated value, repeated credit, purchase bypasses and premature ending triggers (S15).
 Harmless physics comedy and free relocation of an owned lamp can remain; moving property is not
 itself an exploit.

## 9. Tuning targets (validated in prototype; exact values per Rule 8)

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| First purchase | affordable from the first sale; within the first minutes |
| Median time between milestone (capability) purchases | prototype-tuned for fewer, stronger steps; 30–45 min is an earlier hypothesis |
| Purchases affordable at any moment | ≥ 3 |
| Maxed tracks before credits | 50–85% of players (i.e., some left for Continue Playing) |
| Rare find value | ≈ one big upgrade, never several |
| Recovery fee | noticeable, never progress-blocking |
| Resources left at credits | enough for a few remaining sinks, never an absurd pile |
